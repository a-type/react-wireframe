# react-wireframe

Build your React app without providing a UI by filling it in with this placeholder component.

Fits two big use cases:

1. Quickly prototyping business logic or state management without worrying about interaction and display of data.
2. Working on a large team and allowing data-centric developers to build out their features behind feature flags without the aesthetics-centric developers or UX designers having to get involved until the logic is settled.

Still under development. Expect changes in usage and scope.
